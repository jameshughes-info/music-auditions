### November 19th (Warm-up Time 9:30am)

Undergraduate Woodwind candidates must perform two pieces (or movements) of different styles and periods of their own choice. Candidates will also be asked to play some scales and arpeggios in all major and minor keys and sight read.

#### Interview
As part of your audition there will be an informal interview. The panel will be interested to hear you talk about:

+ your artistic influences
+ your inspiration to be a musician
+ your career objectives

This is also an opportunity for you to ask the panel questions about your Department and what life will be like as a musician in Birmingham. If you are an undergraduate applicant, during your interview, as well as a selection of scales, we might ask you to play part of your audition piece(s) again.

This will be an informal opportunity for us to work together and get to know you better as a musician and performer.

## RCM
### December 2nd (12:40pm)

[https://www.rcm.ac.uk/woodwind/auditionrequirements/](https://www.rcm.ac.uk/woodwind/auditionrequirements/)

The time shown on UCAS Conservatoires is your audition time. You should plan to arrive at the RCM at least 30 minutes before this, to allow time to check in and warm up. We advise allowing plenty of extra time for travelling into or across London.

When you arrive at the RCM, you should find out from the steward in the entrance hall where your audition will take place. You will have 20 minutes of warm-up time with your accompanist prior to your audition. We are not able to provide practice rooms for you to use before this.

Woodwind auditions last approximately 20 minutes. Candidates will be directed by the panel to perform their audition pieces or particular extracts. We cannot say in advance which extracts you might be asked to perform, so you should prepare all of the materials in full. You will be required to take a sight-reading test and there will be a short interview.

Typical questions you may be asked during your audition include:

+ Why do you want to study at the RCM?
+ What are your musical interests?
+ What do you think you need to do most to improve your playing?

In some cases you may also be asked to perform scales, arpeggios or other technical exercises.

Some candidates may be referred for a short interview with the Head of Faculty.  If so this will take place on the same day, normally within around an hour of the original audition, so candidates should make travel plans accordingly.  During this interview you may be asked to perform your audition repertoire again unaccompanied.

+ singing the middle notes in a chord
+ identification of intervals
+ sight reading of rhythms
